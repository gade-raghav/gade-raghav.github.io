Computer & Communications undergrad studying at Manupal University Jaipur.
I like to build applications.Full stack web developer. Iâ€™ve worked with django-framework, spring-boot framework, React, Docker, Python and C.
I learn by breaking code wherever I need to figure out why things work the way they do.
