I'm Raghav , studying btech [@MUJ](https://jaipur.manipal.edu/) (Computer and Communication Engineering).

I like to build applications.

I learn by breaking code wherever I need to figure out why things work the way they do. I read documentation but that's just for reference.

What I'm learning : docker,python,django,rest-api,reactjs
