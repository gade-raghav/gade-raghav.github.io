<article class="page">

  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    So, at this point I figured out that there is a template through which we can put our content in **proper** way. We don't have to write title blah blah,
    we can just add content in given template and bam.
  </div>
</article>
