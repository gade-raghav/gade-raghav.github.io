    How hard is it make sym-links
  Very hard? i don't think so.
  This is the first API that I've written, and the following is me trying to make stuff simple for you so that you can break it and then learn.
  The way I define stuff is just to make you comfortable with it. If you find something complicated, [GOOGLE IT](www.google.com) or you can always reach me.
  Let's make mistakes and then learn.

  ***My way is not the ~~right~~ way, but it works.***

  ### What you will build
  -  You will build a simple weather API which gives current  weather 
  -  Later we'll add frontend to it because the terminal is intimidating for me. (Haha)

  ### What you need
  - 15 mins to read but a couple of days to apply what you read.
  - java basics 
  - patience 

  ### Let's get started

  code's on [github](https://github.com/gade-raghav/Info-Weather) for reference

  We are going to use [openweathermap](https://home.openweathermap.org/). Sign in and get your api-id.

  Go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
  - Project-type: Maven
  - Language: Java
  - Dependencies: Spring Web

  Generate it. Unzip it. 

  *I'd strictly advise you to use a code editor (VSCode works for me)*
